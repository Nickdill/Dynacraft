        <div class="article1">Dynacraft was founded in April 2012, and quickly became a favorite server
        to many loyal players. Since then, updates have come, changed things, plugins have
        been abandoned and constantly the server has been changing. Now, were back with a
        new server, website, and even a new support team. So welcome to Dynacraft, and to all returning
        players, welcome back.
